# Important Information
I enjoyed working on the challenge, even though I faced some difficulties, I learned a lot. The app seemed simple at first, but as I started developing the business logic, I realized that it required a lot of hard work. Time management has always been a challenge for me, but I decided to focus on understanding it better this time. I developed and tested everything thoroughly, ensuring that everything was working as expected.

Since I did not have much time and it was a simple project, I decided to use the MVC architectural pattern. It is a pattern that I am familiar with, and it helped me keep the code functional, clean, and organized. For state management, I chose to use MobX, which I have used before in small and medium-sized projects. It saved me time, and in this case, it worked very well.

After completing the project and ensuring that everything was working correctly, I reviewed my code to see if there were any improvements I could make. I believe that it's always a good practice to have a critical look at your project and see what you can improve or change if needed.

Overall, I'm happy to share my work with the community.
